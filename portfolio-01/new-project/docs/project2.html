</p></div> <br><br> <div class="story-body"> <p class="body-text">This analysis was done by using open source data of the city's payroll from 2014 through 2018. </p> <p class="body-text">The majority of these employees work in Manhattan, followed by Queens and then Brooklyn. An interesting finding is that a minority of employees work outsite of New York City, such as in update New York. A smaller group works out of state, including in Delaware and Washington D.C.</p> <p class="body-text">The top two highest paid New York City public employees are both involved with education. Five out of the top 10 highest paid employees work for the Office of the Comptroller (where the Chief Financial Officer for the city works, partially in charge of the city's money). Mayor Bill De Blasio is the 10th highest paid employee.</p> <p class="body-text">See more in the chart below:</p> <br> </div> <div class="story-body"> <h2>Top 10 Highest Paid NYC Public Employees in 2018</h2> <p>Only per annum employees included</p> <div id="bar_chart1"></div> </div> <script src="bar_chart1.c1c67d82.js"></script> <div class="story-body"> <p class="body-text">The highest salaries per agency (paid per annum) vary greatly.
