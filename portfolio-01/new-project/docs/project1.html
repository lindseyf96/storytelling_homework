They have successfully returned 90,632 items back to its owners.</p> <p class="body-text">And while some types of lost categories are predictable -- like wallets, ID's, or cell phones, there are some categories no one would expect, such as musical instruments and transit equipment lost by MTA employees.</p> <p class="body-text"></p> </div> <br> <div class="story-body"> <h2>New Yorkers lose a lot of stuff on public transportation</h2> <p>Here's what the MTA catalogued per category</p> <div id="tree_map"></div> </div> <script src="tree_map.bc672099.js"></script> <br><div class="story-body"> <p class="body-text">Identification items alone make up about 220,000 lost items -- that's about 79 percent of the total amount of objects lost.
