  <p>While the majority of everyone who took the test ended up classified as neutral good, the majority of professors/TA's are chaotic good. Could this be why classes are generally great and informative, yet nothing is ever graded?</p> 
  <p>The Lede Program followed the majority with most students ending up in the neutral good category. Lawful good came in second. Yet, for the MS Data program, there was a three way tie for the majority between neutral good, true neutral, and lawful neutral. Does this mean Lede students are more likely to be good, whereas MS Data students mostly lean toward neutral tendencies? I'll let you interpret the data how you see fit.</p>
  <p>It's about to get really exciting guys. I present to you, a sankey chart. Bonus: you can click and drag each category.</p>
