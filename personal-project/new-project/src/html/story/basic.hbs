  <p class='disclaimer'>Disclaimer: I've never actually played Dungeons and Dragons before. I know, I'm a total fraud. But I'm very obsessed with the alignment chart, and that's what this project is about, so just bear with me on this and yell at me -- or high five me -- later. For the record, I do want to play D&D someday, I just haven't had a chance yet!</p>
  <p>At least half of people reading this are probably confused right now. Alignment of what? What does a chart have to do with a nerdy game? Friend, welcome to the new way you are going to classify everyone in your life.</p>  
<p>First off, you need to know the history behind the alignment chart (and what it actually is). D&D is a roleplaying game, meaning you create a character to play as. Each character has an assigned alignment, which is a categorization of the ethical and moral perspective of the character in the game. To put it simply: what does your character lean more toward? Law or chaos? Good or evil? If neither of the choices for one or both of those questions seem right, an option between the two extremes could work: neutral. This creates the nine options available in the current version of the game (plus a 10th option -- unaligned -- that we are going to ignore). </p> 
  <p>You might be wondering how a character can be law abiding and evil, or chaotic and good. Well, take Robin Hood for example. He steals (which is not great), but he only takes from the rich and then gives everything to the poor, making him chaotic good.</p> <p>These nine terms come together to create the alignment chart, which is the reason this project exists. It is a 3x3 group of squares, and each square is assigned one of the terms. There's also a 5x5 version as well as a terrible triangle version, but we aren't going to focus on those. The best part about the alignment chart is in recent years it's become a huge meme in the Internet community. Here's all nine options with definitions supplied by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)">Wikipedia</a> through an alignment chart meme of some of the 2020 Democratic candidates (accurate as of mid-November 2019). </p><br>

            <h2>To start</h2>
            <p>It's important to note that no one alignment is better than another. They all have pros and cons! Except chaotic evil -- just kidding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-1'>
            <p><b>Lawful Good:</b> A lawful good character typically acts with compassion and always with honor and a sense of duty, though will often regret taking any action they fear would violate their code; even if they recognize such action as being good.</p>
        </div>

         <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-2'>
            <p><b>Lawful Neutral:</b> A lawful neutral character typically believes strongly in lawful concepts such as honor, order, rules, and tradition, but often follows a personal code in addition to, or even in preference to, one set down by a benevolent authority.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-3'>
            <p><b>Lawful Evil:</b> A lawful evil character sees a well-ordered system as being easier to exploit and shows a combination of desirable and undesirable traits.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-4'>
            <p><b>Neutral Good:</b> A neutral good character typically acts altruistically, without regard for or against lawful ideals like rules or tradition. A neutral good character will cooperate with lawful officials, but does not feel beholden to them. When doing the right thing requires rule breaking, they do not experience inner conflict.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-5'>
            <p><b>True Neutral:</b> A true neutral character is neutral on both axes and tends to either not feel strongly towards any alignment or actively seeks an even balance of each category.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-6'>
            <p><b>Neutral Evil:</b> A neutral evil character is typically selfish and makes allies primarily to further their own goals. They have no remorse about harming others to get what they want, but neither go out of their way to cause carnage or mayhem when they see no direct benefit for themselves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-7'>
            <p><b>Chaotic Good:</b> A chaotic good character does what is necessary to bring change for the better, dislikes bureaucracy, and places a high value on personal freedom. Chaotic good characters usually intend to do the right thing, but their methods are disorganized and often out of sync with the rest of society.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-8'>
            <p><b>Chaotic Neutral:</b> A chaotic neutral character is an individualist who follows their own heart and generally shirks rules and traditions. Although chaotic neutral characters promote the ideals of freedom, it is their own freedom that comes first; good and evil come second to their need to be free.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-9'>
            <p><b>Chaotic Evil:</b> A chaotic evil character tends to have no respect for rules, other people's lives, or anything but their own desires, which are typically selfish and cruel. Chaotic evil characters do not work well in groups because they resent being given orders and do not usually behave themselves unless there is no alternative.</p>

  <p style="clear: both;">In addition to what is now a staple meme, someone created an <a href="http://easydamus.com/alignmenttest.html">actual test to determine your alignment</a>. This is what I asked people to take in the summer program, which consisted of both MS Data students and Lede Program certificate students. There were 41 students, six TA's, and six professors during the summer session. Yet, when I asked everyone to take the alignment test, only 15 students, three TA's, and one professor did it. Bummer right? In everyone else's defense, the test is kinda time consuming. All of the analysis is with the 19 people who took the test.</p>
  <p>Now, here's what you've been waiting for:</p>
