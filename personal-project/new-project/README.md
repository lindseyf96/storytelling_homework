# The Alignment of Lede and MS Data Students

I asked people in the Columbia University journalism Lede program, along with students in the journalism MS data program, to take the [alignment test](http://easydamus.com/alignmenttest.html). The test originated through Dungeons and Dragons, but over time resulted in a subsequent alignment chart, which has become a [viral Internet meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlignmentCharts/).

For more context, D&D is a roleplaying game, meaning you create a character to play as. Each character has an assigned alignment, which is a categorization of the ethical and moral perspective of the character in the game. To put it simply: what does your character lean more toward? Law or chaos? Good or evil? If neither of the choices for one or both of those questions seem right, an option between the two extremes could work: neutral. This, plus unaligned, creates the ten options available in the current version of the game: lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral good, true neutral, neutral evil, chaotic good, chaotic neutral, and chaotic evil. My project analyzes what the students in the two chosen programs are, and if there are any patterns. 

The dataset used was the name of each student who took the test, the program he or she is in, and each person's alignment.
